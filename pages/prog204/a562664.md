  【新唐人2011年7月21日讯】自
  <ok href="https://www.ntdtv.com/gb/江泽民.htm">
   江泽民
  </ok>
  病危及病死的消息传出以来，如何给江泽民盖棺定论，已成为中共当局极具争议和头痛的事情，甚至由此引发政治斗争。江泽民的生平劣迹，也引起海内外各界的关注。本台对江泽民的恶行丑事做出系列报导，今天的话题是江泽民“自毁中共”。
 </p>
 <p>
  <ok href="https://www.ntdtv.com/gb/江泽民.htm">
   江泽民
  </ok>
  当政期间，在党章和宪法中引进了“三个代表”，践踏宪法和法律，迫害信仰和异己，严控舆论，党政军全面腐败，加剧党内分裂，江泽民从共产党内部毁掉了中共政权。
 </p>
 <p>
  所谓“三个代表”，只是三句并无实质内容的空话，由中南海“智囊”王沪宁提出，江泽民把它背诵下来就变成了江的理论，十六大作为党的指导思想写入党章，并让中共喉舌捧上了天。
 </p>
 <p>
  《北京之春》主编、政论家胡平：“中国共产党它不管它自称代表任何阶级、任何利益、任何阶层，实际上都是不成立的。这个提出‘三个代表’理论到底对中国的政治经济有什么影响呢？应该说影响还是有的，它最主要的就体现在，在经济上进一步的引进资本主义，但同时也是权贵私有化的固化成型。”
 </p>
 <p>
  江泽民一方面用“三个代表”为中共权贵利益集团寻找理论依据，实行“权贵私有化”﹔另一方面，人大委员长吴邦国和党报却坚称，不搞私有化。
 </p>
 <p>
  时事评论家横河：“那么这个‘三个代表’把毛泽东时代的所谓‘中国革命’的整个意义全部否定掉了，因为它已经可以发展新兴资本家入党就这些，也就是说把当时1949年所谓的‘无产阶级革命’这个给否定掉。”
 </p>
 <p>
  前国家主席杨尚昆临终时在遗嘱中指出，“三个代表”是垃圾论，实际上代表“三座大山”，把共产主义出卖了，绝不能放入宪法，也要尽快从党章中拿掉。
 </p>
 <p>
  一位出生入死的老党员张鲁石在退党声明中说，“听了江泽民的讲话，我当场气得吐了血。”“共产党的腐败令人触目惊心，超过了原来的国民党。”
 </p>
 <p>
  时事评论家陈破空：“如果说共产党是‘三个代表’，那便是：代表贪官，代表奸商，代表黑社会。即那些依靠官商勾结、权钱交易而‘先富起来’的少数人。”
 </p>
 <p>
  “三个代表”在党内外遭到广泛批评，造成了中共意识形态的自相矛盾，加剧党内权力斗争和派系分裂。十七大前夕，170名离休高官集体上书说，“三个代表”是“挂羊头卖狗肉”，导致了目前的贪污腐败现象。
 </p>
 <p>
  胡锦涛在中共建党90周年的讲话中，承认党内腐败的严重性和危险性，声称反腐败“关系人心向背和党的生死存亡”。
 </p>
 <p>
  《中国事务》主编伍凡：“江泽民他说：‘反贪就亡党，不反贪就亡国’，他就问共产党：‘你们这些党员们、这些高级干部们，你们要不要反贪？要反贪就是把共产党反掉了，你们愿意吗？’所以在这么一个政策指导下，共产党普遍的贪污。”
 </p>
 <p>
  江当政13年来，中国出现了政治、人权、法制大倒退，江大规模镇压法轮功、家庭教会、中国民主党、民运人士、维权民众、少数民族等等，每年至少有数十万人被劳教，每年处决的犯人占世界总数的90%以上。
 </p>
 <p>
  言论控制也达到了顶峰，江的儿子江绵恒一手打造的“金盾工程”，初期工程就投资64亿元人民币，将12.5亿中国人的资讯纳入公安部门的监控系统。中国成为世界上关押记者和网民最多的国家。
 </p>
 <p>
  尤其是，江泽民与中共相互利用，动用全部国家机器和四分之一财力，无视法律，滥用酷刑，迫害信仰“真、善、忍”的法轮功，导致社会道德急速下滑，彻底中断了中国20多年来的法制进程，拖垮了中共政权。
 </p>
 <p>
  随着专制腐败日趋严重，大量工人下岗，贫富两极分化，社会不公加剧，暴力拆迁、维权抗暴事件频频发生，江泽民把中共彻底推向了公开与人民为敌、面临危机和解体的境地。
 </p>
 <p>
  2004年11月，揭露中共邪恶本质的《九评共产党》发表，引发了席卷中国的退党大潮，促使中国人走向精神觉醒，摆脱对中共暴政的恐惧，通过退党、退团、退队在组织上解体中共。
 </p>
 <p>
  全球退党服务中心主席易蓉：“就是中共内部也有许许多多的人讨厌共产党，也根本就不信共产党，因为它们为利益驱使，那么他们也很讨厌江泽民，所以，我相信会有很多人能够越来越觉悟。”
 </p>
 <p>
  全球退党服务中心主席易蓉指出，毁于江泽民之手的共产党，早已是名存实亡了。江泽民和中共罪恶深重，而“退出中共组织”是为了自救，以免在不久的将来中共解体时随着陪葬。目前，在《大纪元》“退党网站”上声明退出中共党、团、队组织的人数已经接近一亿人。

  Truth about Jiang Zemin: Part IX
 </p>
 <p>
  Jiang Zemin’s death or illness has led to a dispute in
  <br/>
  the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) regarding Jiang’s life.
  <br/>
  Jiang’s notorious deeds have attracted wide attention.
  <br/>
  NTD is making a series of reports on Jiang’s life.
  <br/>
  Our today’s topic is
  <br/>
  Jiang Zemin’s crimes destroying his own party.
 </p>
 <p>
  During the reign of Jiang,
  <br/>
  he introduced the theory “Three Represents”
  <br/>
  into the constitution of the CCP,
  <br/>
  as well as into the Constitution of China.
  <br/>
  He trampled the Constitution and the law;
  <br/>
  persecuted religious beliefs and dissidents;
  <br/>
  controlled the media; and caused widespread
  <br/>
  corruption within the CCP, government and army.
  <br/>
  As a result, under Jiang’s leadership,
  <br/>
  the CCP was being destroyed from within.
 </p>
 <p>
  The so-called “Three Represents” are
  <br/>
  just three unsubstantiated sentences.
  <br/>
  It was brought out by Wang Huning,
  <br/>
  the “think tank” of Zhongnanhai.
  <br/>
  By reciting it,
  <br/>
  Jiang turned it into his own theory.
  <br/>
  It was written into the CCP’s constitution
  <br/>
  and was praised by CCP’s mouthpieces.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hu Ping (Editor of Beijing Spring magazine;
  <br/>
  political commentator):
  <br/>
  No matter how the CCP claims that
 </p>
 <p>
  it represents all social strata,
  <br/>
  all interest groups and all classes,
  <br/>
  it can not become true.
 </p>
 <p>
  What on Earth is the impact of the
  <br/>
  “Three Represents” to Chinese politics and economy?
  <br/>
  I think that it had certain influence
  <br/>
  on the further introduction of capitalism
  <br/>
  and formation of ”elite privatization.”
 </p>
 <p>
  On one hand, Jiang used “Three Represents”
  <br/>
  as theoretical foundation for CCP’s interest groups
  <br/>
  to realize the elite privatization.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the other hand, National People’s Congress
  <br/>
  (NPC) chair Wu Bangguo and party newspaper
  <br/>
  say that the CCP insists on no privatization.
 </p>
 <p>
  Heng He (current issues commentator):
 </p>
 <p>
  “These so-called ’Three Represents’ theory
  <br/>
  repeals effectively Mao’s so-called ’Chinese Revolution,’
  <br/>
  because it now allows new capitalists
  <br/>
  to join the CCP.
  <br/>
  This means that it has repealed
  <br/>
  the so-called ’proletarian revolution’ in 1949.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The CCP’s ex-president Yang Shangkun
  <br/>
  wrote in his will that
  <br/>
  the “Three Represents” theory is rubbish.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yang wrote that it stands for
  <br/>
  “three big mountains"
  <br/>
  and has betrayed the CCP.
 </p>
 <p>
  Therefore, it must not be written in the Constitution,
  <br/>
  and should be removed from the CCP’s constitution too.
 </p>
 <p>
  Veteran soldier Zhang Lushi
  <br/>
  went through fire and water for the CCP.
  <br/>
  He wrote in his statement to quit the CCP:
 </p>
 <p>
  “After listening to Jiang’s speech,
  <br/>
  I was enraged to vomit blood on the spot."
  <br/>
  “The CCP’s shocking corruption
  <br/>
  has surpassed that of the Kuomintang.”
 </p>
 <p>
  Chen Po Kong
  <br/>
  (current issues commentator):
  <br/>
  If the CCP is to represent three things,
 </p>
 <p>
  then it represents corrupt officials,
  <br/>
  profiteers and underground societies.
  <br/>
  A ”small number” of people got rich
  <br/>
  by corruption and by trading power with money.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Three Represents” has been widely criticized
  <br/>
  inside and outside the CCP,
  <br/>
  resulting in the CCP fractions’
  <br/>
  internal power struggles.
  <br/>
  On the eve of CCP’s 17th Congress,
  <br/>
  170 retired senior officials appealed together
  <br/>
  that the “Three Represents”
  <br/>
  had led to this corruption.
 </p>
 <p>
  In his speech for the CCP’s 90th anniversary,
 </p>
 <p>
  Hu Jintao acknowledged the seriousness
  <br/>
  and the dangers of corruption within the CCP.
  <br/>
  He claimed that anti-corruption
  <br/>
  “is related to the party’s popularity and survival."
 </p>
 <p>
  Wu Fan (China Affairs Editor-in-Chief):
  <br/>
  Jiang said,
  <br/>
  “Anti-Corruption will lead to the CCP’s death;
  <br/>
  otherwise, it will lead to China’s death.’
  <br/>
  Jiang asked the CCP members,
  <br/>
  “Do you want to implement anti-corruption actions?
  <br/>
  Anti-corruption will turn into anti-CCP.
  <br/>
  Do you want that?“
  <br/>
  Being guided by such a policy,
  <br/>
  the CCP members in general are corrupt.
 </p>
 <p>
  Under Jiang’s 13 years long rule,
  <br/>
  there were great backslides in China,
  <br/>
  in terms of politics, human rights
  <br/>
  and the rule of law.
  <br/>
  Jiang has launched large-scale persecution
  <br/>
  of Falun Gong practitioners, house churches,
  <br/>
  China Democracy Party, human rights activists
  <br/>
  and ethnic minorities.
  <br/>
  Every year hundreds of thousands
  <br/>
  were thrown in labor camps.
  <br/>
  More than 90% of the world’s execution
  <br/>
  took place in China each year.
 </p>
 <p>
  Under Jiang,
  <br/>
  the CCP’s speech control reached its peak.
  <br/>
  His son Jiang Mianheng single-handedly executed
  <br/>
  the implementation of the “Golden Shield Project",
  <br/>
  whose initial phase cost RMB 6.4 billion.
 </p>
 <p>
  He also placed 1.25 billion
  <br/>
  Chinese people’s information
  <br/>
  into the police monitoring system.
 </p>
 <p>
  China has become the state with
 </p>
 <p>
  the most imprisoned correspondents
  <br/>
  and netizens in the world
 </p>
 <p>
  In particular, Jiang and the CCP
  <br/>
  colluded to use the state machine
  <br/>
  and 25% of China’s resources
  <br/>
  to persecute Falun Dafa practitioners,
  <br/>
  in defiance of the law.
 </p>
 <p>
  Their abuses and tortures of practitioners,
  <br/>
  who believe in “Truthfulness, Compassion and Tolerance",
  <br/>
  have led to rapid social and moral decline.
 </p>
 <p>
  They disregarded China’s legal process and
  <br/>
  caused the imminent collapse of the CCP’s regime.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the aggravating corruption
  <br/>
  and tyranny in China,
  <br/>
  a large number of workers are laid off,
  <br/>
  the polarization between rich and poor is deepening,
  <br/>
  social injustice exacerbates
  <br/>
  and violent demolitions occur frequently.
  <br/>
  Jiang has completely turned CCP
  <br/>
  into the enemy of the people.
  <br/>
  Now the CCP is facing a crisis of disintegration.
 </p>
 <p>
  In November 2004,
 </p>
 <p>
  “Nine Commentaries on the Communist Party"
  <br/>
  were published.
  <br/>
  They exposed the CCP’s evil nature
 </p>
 <p>
  and triggered a sweeping tide of
  <br/>
  withdrawals from the CCP.
  <br/>
  It propelled the Chinese people
  <br/>
  towards spiritual awakening.
  <br/>
  The people got rid of
  <br/>
  their fear of the CCP’s tyranny.
  <br/>
  Through quitting the CCP
  <br/>
  and its affiliated organizations,
  <br/>
  they are disintegrating the CCP.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yi Rong (Chair, Global Center for Quitting the CCP):
  <br/>
  Within the CCP,
 </p>
 <p>
  there are many people that hate the CCP
  <br/>
  and don’t believe in the CCP.
  <br/>
  These people are only motivated by money.
  <br/>
  They actually hate Jiang.
  <br/>
  So, I believe that many people
  <br/>
  will come to their senses.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rong Yi pointed out that the CCP
  <br/>
  has been destroyed by Jiang.
  <br/>
  Now it exists in name only.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jiang and the CCP have committed numerous crimes.
 </p>
 <p>
  “Quitting the CCP" is for people to save themselves.
  <br/>
  Currently, on the website of The Epoch Times
  <br/>
  nearly 100 million people have published statements
  <br/>
  to quit the CCP and its affiliated organizations.
