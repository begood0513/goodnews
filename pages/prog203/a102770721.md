  在国会联席会议上发表

   国情咨文
  </ok>
  演说，主题为“伟大美国回归”（The Great American Comeback）。
 </p>
 <p>
  下面是全文翻译第六部分：
 </p>
 <p>
  In the last three years, ICE has arrested over 5,000 wicked human traffickers.  And I have signed nine pieces of legislation to stamp out the menace of human trafficking, domestically and all around the globe.  My administration has undertaken an unprecedented effort to secure the southern border of the United States.  (Applause.)
  <br/>
  在过去三年中，美国移民和海关执法局（ICE）逮捕了5,000多名邪恶的人口贩子。我已经签署了九项立法，以消除国内和全球人口贩运的威胁。我国政府为确保美国南部边界作出了空前的努力。 （掌声。）
 </p>
 <p>
  Before I came into office, if you showed up illegally on our southern border and were arrested, you were simply released and allowed into our country, never to be seen again.  My administration has ended catch and release.  (Applause.)  If you come illegally, you will now be promptly removed from our country.  (Applause.)
  <br/>
  在我上任之前，如果你非法到达我们的南部边界并被捕，你将被释放并被允许进入我们的国家，再也不会被看到。我的政府已结束追捕和释放这一做法。 （掌声）如果你非法入境，你将即时被从我们国家遣返。 （掌声。）
 </p>
 <p>
  Very importantly, we entered into historic cooperation agreements with the governments of Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala.  As a result of our unprecedented efforts, illegal crossings are down 75 percent since May, dropping eight straight months in a row.  (Applause.)  And as the wall rapidly goes up, drug seizures rise, and the border crossings are down, and going down very rapidly.
  <br/>
  非常重要的是，我们与墨西哥，洪都拉斯，萨尔瓦多和危地马拉政府达成了历史性合作协议。由于我们进行了空前的努力，自5月以来，非法入境点下降了75％，连续八个月下降。 （掌声）随着隔离墙的迅速建起，毒品的缉获量上升，过境点下降，下降速度非常快。
 </p>
 <p>
  Last year, I traveled to the border in Texas and met Chief Patrol Agent Raul Ortiz.  Over the last 24 months, Agent Ortiz and his team have seized more than 200,000 pounds of poisonous narcotics, arrested more than 3,000 human smugglers, and rescued more than 2,000 migrants.  Days ago, Agent Ortiz was promoted to Deputy Chief of Border Patrol, and he joins us tonight.  Chief Ortiz, please stand.  (Applause.)  A grateful nation thanks you and all of the heroes of Border Patrol and ICE.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  (Applause.)
  <br/>
  去年，我去了德克萨斯州的边境，见到了首席巡逻员劳尔·奥尔蒂斯。在过去的24个月中，巡逻官员奥尔蒂斯和他的团队缉获了超过200,000磅的有毒麻醉品，逮捕了3000多名人口走私者，并拯救了2000多名移民。几天前，巡逻官奥尔蒂斯被提升为边境巡逻队副团长，他今晚将加入我们。奥尔蒂斯团长，请站起来。 （掌声）感激的国家谢谢你以及边境巡逻队和美国移民和海关执法局（ICE）的所有英雄。非常感谢你。谢谢。 （掌声。）
 </p>
 <p>
  To build on these historic gains, we are working on legislation to replace our outdated and randomized immigration system with one based on merit, welcoming those who follow the rules, contribute to our economy, support themselves financially, and uphold our values.  (Applause.)
  <br/>
  基于这些历史性的成就，我们正在制定法律，以此取代过时的，随机的移民体系，并欢迎那些遵守规则，为我们的经济做出贡献，在经济上支持自己并维护我们的价值观的人们。 （掌声。）
 </p>
 <p>
  With every action, my administration is restoring the rule of law and reasserting the culture of American freedom. (Applause.)  Working with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell — thank you, Mitch — (applause) — and his colleagues in the Senate, we have confirmed a record number of 187 new federal judges to uphold our Constitution as written.  This includes two brilliant new Supreme Court justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  And we have many in the pipeline.  (Laughter and applause.)
  <br/>
  我的政府将采取一切行动，恢复法治，并重申美国的自由文化。 （掌声）与参议院多数党领袖米奇·麦康奈尔一起工作-谢谢米奇-（掌声）-和他在参议院的同事们合作，我们确认了创纪录的数字187名新联邦法官，将遵守我们的宪法。其中包括两位杰出的新任最高法院法官，尼尔·戈拉奇和布雷特·卡瓦诺。谢谢。 （掌声）我们还有很多法官入选。 （笑声和掌声）
 </p>
 <p>
  My administration is also defending religious liberty, and that includes the constitutional right to pray in public schools.  (Applause.)  In America, we don’t punish prayer.  We don’t tear down crosses.  We don’t ban symbols of faith.  We don’t muzzle preachers and pastors.  In America, we celebrate faith, we cherish religion, we lift our voices in prayer, and we raise our sights to the Glory of God.
  <br/>
  我的政府还捍卫宗教自由，其中包括宪法规定的在公立学校祈祷的权利。 （掌声）在美国，我们不惩罚祈祷。我们不拆十字架。我们不禁止信仰的象征物。我们不封口传教士和牧师。在美国，我们庆祝信仰，珍惜宗教，在高声祷告，并把目光投向了神的荣耀。
 </p>
 <p>
  Just as we believe in the First Amendment, we also believe in another constitutional right that is under siege all across our country.  So long as I am President, I will always protect your Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.  (Applause.)
  <br/>
  正如我们相信《第一修正案》一样，我们也相信另一项宪法权利正在全国范围内遭到围困。只要我是总统，我将永远保护你们的第二修正案保留和携带武器的权利。 （掌声。）
 </p>
 <p>
  In reaffirming our heritage as a free nation, we must remember that America has always been a frontier nation.  Now we must embrace the next frontier, America’s manifest destiny in the stars.  I am asking Congress to fully fund the Artemis program to ensure that the next man and the first woman on the Moon will be American astronauts — (applause) — using this as a launching pad to ensure that America is the first nation to plant its flag on Mars.  (Applause.)
  <br/>
  在重申我们自由国家的传统时，我们必须记住，美国一直是前沿国家。现在，我们必须拥抱下一个前沿领域，即美国在星空中的命运。我要求国会全额资助阿耳忒弥斯计划，以确保下一个男士和月球上的第一个女士成为美国宇航员（鼓掌），以此作为开启点，以确保美国是第一个在火星上悬挂美国旗帜的国家。 （掌声。）
 </p>
 <p>
  My administration is also strongly defending our national security and combating radical Islamic terrorism.  (Applause.)
  <br/>
  我国政府还坚决捍卫我们的国家安全和打击激进的伊斯兰恐怖主义。 （掌声。）
 </p>
 <p>
  Last week, I announced a groundbreaking plan for peace between Israel and the Palestinians.  Recognizing that all past attempts have failed, we must be determined and creative in order to stabilize the region and give millions of young people the chance to realize a better future.
  <br/>
  上周，我宣布了一项有突破性计划，即以色列与巴勒斯坦人之间和平计划。认识到过去的所有尝试都失败了，我们必须坚定并富有创造力，以稳定该地区并为数以百万计的年轻人提供实现美好未来的机会。
 </p>
 <p>
  Three years ago, the barbarians of ISIS held over 20,000 square miles of territory in Iraq and Syria.  Today, the ISIS territorial caliphate has been 100 percent destroyed, and the founder and leader of ISIS — the bloodthirsty killer known as al-Baghdadi — is dead.  (Applause.)
  <br/>
  三年前，ISIS的野蛮人占领了伊拉克和叙利亚超过20,000平方英里的领土。如今，ISIS的领土哈里发已被100％摧毁，ISIS的创始人和领导人-嗜血杀手巴格达迪死了。 （掌声。）
 </p>
 <p>
  We are joined this evening by Carl and Marsha Mueller.  After graduating from college, their beautiful daughter Kayla became a humanitarian aid worker.  She once wrote, “Some people find God in church.  Some people find God in nature.  Some people find God in love.  I find God in suffering.  I’ve known for some time what my life’s work is, using my hands as tools to relieve suffering.”  In 2013, while caring for suffering civilians in Syria, Kayla was kidnapped, tortured, and enslaved by ISIS, and kept as a prisoner of al-Baghdadi himself.  After more than 500 horrifying days of captivity, al-Baghdadi murdered young, beautiful Kayla.  She was just 26 years old.
  <br/>
  今天晚上，卡尔和玛莎·穆勒加入了我们。大学毕业后，他们美丽的女儿凯拉成为一名人道主义援助工作者。她曾经写道：“有些人在教堂里找到上帝。有些人大在自然中找到上帝。有人在爱中找到了上帝。我在苦难中找到了上帝。我已经知道自己的工作是什么，用我的双手作为减轻痛苦的工具。”2013年，在照顾叙利亚遭受苦难的平民时，凯拉被ISIS绑架，折磨和奴役，被巴格达迪亲自囚禁。经过500多天的恐怖囚禁，巴格达迪杀死了年轻漂亮的凯拉。她只有26岁。
 </p>
 <p>
  On the night that U.S. Special Forces Operations ended al-Baghdadi’s miserable life, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, received a call in the Situation Room.  He was told that the brave men of the elite Special Forces team that so perfectly carried out the operation had given their mission a name: “Task Force 8-14.”  It was a reference to a special day: August 14th — Kayla’s birthday.  Carl and Marsha, America’s warriors never forgot Kayla — and neither will we.  Thank you.  (Applause.)
  <br/>
  在美国特种部队行动结束巴格达迪可悲一生的那天晚上，参谋长联席会议主席马克·米尔利将军在战情室接到了电话。有人告诉他，精通特种部队的英勇精锐团队的士兵给他们的任务起了个名字：“8-14特遣部队”。它指的是特殊的日子：8月14日-凯拉的生日。美国勇士卡尔和玛莎从未忘记凯拉-我们也不会。谢谢。 （掌声。）
 </p>
 <p>
  Every day, America’s men and women in uniform demonstrate the infinite depth of love that dwells in the human heart.
  <br/>
  每天，穿着制服的美国男士和女士展现出无限的存在于人心中的爱。
 </p>
 <p>
  One of these American heroes was Army Staff Sergeant Christopher Hake.  On his second deployment to Iraq in 2008, Sergeant Hake wrote a letter to his one-year-old son, Gage: “I will be with you again,” he wrote to Gage.  “I will teach you to ride your first bike, build your first sand box, watch you play sports, and see you have kids also.  I love you son.  Take care of your mother.  I am always with you.  Daddy.”
  <br/>
  这些美国英雄之一是陆军参谋长克里斯托弗·哈克。在哈克中士2008年第二次被派驻到伊拉克时，他给他一岁的儿子盖奇写了一封信：“我会再和你在一起，”他写信给盖奇“我会教你骑你的第一个自行车，建立第一个沙箱（玩具），看你参加运动以及一直到看你有孩子。我爱你，儿子。照顾你的妈妈。我一直和你在一起。爸爸。”
 </p>
 <p>
  On Easter Sunday of 2008, Chris was out on patrol in Baghdad when his Bradley Fighting Vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb.  That night, he made the ultimate sacrifice for our country.  Sergeant Hake now rests in eternal glory in Arlington, and his wife Kelli is in the Gallery tonight, joined by their son, who is now a 13-year-old and doing very, very well.  To Kelli and Gage: Chris will live in our hearts forever.  He is looking down on you now.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Thank you very much.  Thank you both very much.
  <br/>
  在2008年复活节星期天，克里斯托弗在巴格达巡逻，他的布雷德利战车被路边炸弹击中。那天晚上，他为我国作出了最终的牺牲。哈克中士现在安息在阿灵顿（美国国家公墓）拥有永恒的荣耀，他的妻子凯莉今晚也在会议厅，还有他们的儿子，儿子现在已经13岁了，做得非常非常好。对凯莉和凯莉说：克里斯将永远活在我们的心中。他现在在天堂关注你们。谢谢。 （掌声）非常感谢。非常感谢你们。
 </p>
 <p>
  The terrorist responsible for killing Sergeant Hake was Qasem Soleimani, who provided the deadly roadside bomb that took Chris’s life.  Soleimani was the Iranian regime’s most ruthless butcher, a monster who murdered or wounded thousands of American service members in Iraq.  As the world’s top terrorist, Soleimani orchestrated the deaths of countless men, women, and children.  He directed the December assault and went on to assault U.S. forces in Iraq.  Was actively planning new attacks when we hit him very hard.  And that’s why, last month, at my direction, the U.S. military executed a flawless precision strike that killed Soleimani and terminated his evil reign of terror forever.  (Applause.)
  <br/>
  杀死哈克中士的恐怖分子是苏兰曼尼，他提供了致命的路边炸弹，炸死了克里斯。苏兰曼尼是伊朗政权最残酷的屠夫，是一个在伊拉克谋杀或伤害数千名美国服役军人的怪物。作为世界上最大的恐怖分子，苏兰曼尼精心策划了无数男女老幼死亡的事件。他指挥了12月的袭击，并继续向驻伊美军进攻。当我们给他致命的打击时，他正在积极计划新的攻击。因此，上个月，在我的指导下，美国军方进行了一次完美无瑕的精确打击，杀死了苏兰曼尼，并永远终止了他的邪恶恐怖统治。 （掌声。）
 </p>
 <p>
  Our message to the terrorists is clear: You will never escape American justice.  If you attack our citizens, you forfeit your life.  (Applause.)
  <br/>
  我们给恐怖分子的信息很明确：你将永远无法逃脱美国的法律制裁。如果你攻击我们的公民，你将偿命。 （掌声。）
 </p>
 <p>
  In recent months, we have seen proud Iranians raise their voices against their oppressive rulers.  The Iranian regime must abandon its pursuit of nuclear weapons; stop spreading terror, death, and destruction; and start working for the good of its own people.
  <br/>
  近几个月来，我们看到自豪的伊朗人民对压迫性统治者发声。伊朗政权必须放弃追求发展核武器；停止传播恐怖，死亡和毁灭；并开始为自己的人民的利益而工作。
 </p>
 <p>
  Because of our powerful sanctions, the Iranian economy is doing very, very poorly.  We can help them make a very good and short-time recovery.  It can all go very quickly, but perhaps they are too proud or too foolish to ask for that help.  We are here.  Let’s see which road they choose.  It is totally up to them.  (Applause.)
  <br/>
  由于我们的强大的制裁，伊朗经济情况非常非常糟糕。我们可以帮助他们在短期内恢复。一切都可以很快进行，但是也许他们太骄傲或太愚蠢而不去寻求帮助。我们在这里。让我们看看他们选择哪条路。这完全取决于他们。 （掌声。）
 </p>
 <p>
  As we defend American lives, we are working to end America’s wars in the Middle East.
  <br/>
  在我们捍卫美国人民生命的同时，我们正在努力结束美国在中东的战争。
 </p>
 <p>
  In Afghanistan, the determination and valor of our warfighters has allowed us to make tremendous progress, and peace talks are now underway.  I am not looking to kill hundreds of thousands of people in Afghanistan, many of them totally innocent.  It is also not our function to serve other nations as law enforcement agencies.  These are warfighters that we have — the best in the world — and they either want to fight to win or not fight at all.  We are working to finally end America’s longest war and bring our troops back home.  (Applause.)
  <br/>
  在
  <ok href="https://www.ntdtv.com/gb/阿富汗.htm">
   阿富汗
  </ok>
  ，我们战士的决心和英勇使我们取得了巨大的进展，现在和平谈判正在进行中。我不想杀害阿富汗成千上万的人，他们其中许多人完全是无辜的。作为执法机构为其它国家服务也不是我们的职责。这些是世界上最好的战士，他们要么为胜利而战，要么根本不战。我们正在努力最终结束美国最长的战争，并让我们的军队带回家。（掌声。）
 </p>
 <p>
  War places a heavy burden on our nation’s extraordinary military families, especially spouses like Amy Williams from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and her two children — six-year-old Elliana and three-year-old Rowan.  Amy works full-time and volunteers countless hours helping other military families.  For the past seven months, she has done it all while her husband, Sergeant First Class Townsend Williams, is in Afghanistan on his fourth deployment in the Middle East.  Amy’s kids haven’t seen their father’s face in many months.  Amy, your family’s sacrifice makes it possible for all of our families to live in safety and in peace, and we want to thank you.  Thank you, Amy.  (Applause.)
  <br/>
  战争给美国非凡的军人家庭带来了沉重负担，尤其是诸如北卡罗来纳州福特堡的艾米·威廉姆斯的配偶，以及她的两个孩子，分别是六岁的埃里安娜和三岁的罗文。艾米有全职工作，她也做了无数小时的志愿者，帮助其他军人家庭。在过去的七个月中，她所做的一切，都是在她的丈夫汤森德·威廉姆斯中士在
  <ok href="https://www.ntdtv.com/gb/阿富汗.htm">
   阿富汗
  </ok>
  ，也就是被第四次派往中东驻扎时期完成的。艾米的孩子们已经好几个月没有看到父亲的脸了。艾米，你的家人的牺牲使我们所有的家庭可以安全与和平的生活，我们要感谢你。谢谢你，艾米。 （掌声。）
 </p>
 <p>
  But, Amy, there is one more thing.  Tonight, we have a very special surprise.  I am thrilled to inform you that your husband is back from deployment.  He is here with us tonight, and we couldn’t keep him waiting any longer.  (Applause.)
  <br/>
  但是，艾米，还有一件事。今晚，我们有一个非常特别的惊喜。我很高兴地通知你，你的丈夫已从驻军地归来。今晚他与我们同在，我们一刻也不能让他再等待了。 （掌声。）
 </p>
 <p>
  AUDIENCE:  USA!  USA!  USA!
  <br/>
  听众：美国！美国！美国！
 </p>
 <p>
  THE PRESIDENT:  Welcome home, Sergeant Williams.  Thank you very much.
  <br/>
  总统：欢迎回家，威廉姆斯中士。非常感谢你。
 </p>
 <p>
  As the world bears witness tonight, America is a land of heroes.  This is a place where greatness is born, where destinies are forged, and where legends come to life.  This is the home of Thomas Edison and Teddy Roosevelt, of many great generals including Washington, Pershing, Patton, and MacArthur.  This is the home of Abraham Lincoln, Frederick Douglass, Amelia Earhart, Harriet Tubman, the Wright Brothers, Neil Armstrong, and so many more.  This is the country where children learn names like Wyatt Earp, Davy Crockett, and Annie Oakley.  This is the place where the pilgrims landed at Plymouth and where Texas patriots made their last stand at the Alamo — (applause) — the beautiful, beautiful Alamo.
  <br/>
  正如今晚世界见证的一样，美国是英雄国度。这里孕育著伟大，锻造著命运，展现著传奇。这是托马斯·爱迪生和泰迪·罗斯福的故乡，许多伟大的将军都曾在这里居住，包括华盛顿，潘兴，巴顿和麦克阿瑟。这是亚伯拉罕·林肯，弗雷德里克·道格拉斯，阿米莉亚·艾哈特，哈丽特·塔布曼，莱特兄弟，尼尔·阿姆斯特朗等人的故乡。在这个国家，孩子们会学习诸如怀亚特厄普、戴维·克罗克特和安妮·欧克丽这样的名字。之类的名字。这是朝圣者登陆普利茅斯的地方，也是得克萨斯州的爱国者在美丽的阿拉莫（掌声）最后的据点。
 </p>
 <p>
  The American nation was carved out of the vast frontier by the toughest, strongest, fiercest, and most determined men and women ever to walk on the face of the Earth.  Our ancestors braved the unknown; tamed the wilderness; settled the Wild West; lifted millions from poverty, disease, and hunger; vanquished tyranny and fascism; ushered the world to new heights of science and medicine; laid down the railroads, dug out the canals, raised up the skyscrapers.  And, ladies and gentlemen, our ancestors built the most exceptional republic ever to exist in all of human history, and we are making it greater than ever before.  (Applause.)
  <br/>
  美国这个国家是由地球上有史以来最坚强、最强大、最猛、最坚定的男士盒女士在辽阔土地上开拓出来的。我们的祖先勇敢面对未知。驯服了旷野；拓荒狂野的西部；使数百万人摆脱了贫困，疾病和饥饿；战胜了暴政和法西斯主义；将世界带入科学和医学的新高度；铺铁路，挖运河，建造摩天大楼。女士们，先生们，我们的祖先们建立了人类历史上有史以来最杰出的共和国，而且我们正在使它比以往任何时候都更大。 （掌声。）
 </p>
 <p>
  This is our glorious and magnificent inheritance.  We are Americans.  We are pioneers.  We are the pathfinders.  We settled the New World, we built the modern world, and we changed history forever by embracing the eternal truth that everyone is made equal by the hand of Almighty God.  (Applause.)
  <br/>
  这是我们光辉灿烂的遗产。我们是美国人。我们是先驱者。我们是开拓者。我们建立了新世界，我们建立了现代世界，我们永远改变了历史，因为我们拥抱永恒的真理，即万能的神创造人并使人人平等。 （掌声。）
 </p>
 <p>
  America is the place where anything can happen.  America is the place where anyone can rise.  And here, on this land, on this soil, on this continent, the most incredible dreams come true.
  <br/>
  美国是一个发生什么事情都有可能发生的地方。美国是任何人都能崛起的地方。在这里，这片土地上，在这片大陆上，最不可思议的梦想得以实现。
 </p>
 <p>
  This nation is our canvas, and this country is our masterpiece.  We look at tomorrow and see unlimited frontiers just waiting to be explored.  Our brightest discoveries are not yet known.  Our most thrilling stories are not yet told.  Our grandest journeys are not yet made.  The American Age, the American Epic, the American adventure has only just begun.这个国家是我们的画布，这个国家是我们的杰作。我们展望明天，看到无限的前沿领域等着我们去探索。我们最重大的发现还不为人所知，我们最激动人心的故事还没有讲完，我们最伟大的旅程还没有开始。美国的时代，美国的史诗，美国的冒险刚刚起步。
 </p>
 <p>
  Our spirit is still young, the sun is still rising, God’s grace is still shining, and, my fellow Americans, the best is yet to come.  (Applause.)
  <br/>
  我们的精神还年轻，太阳仍在升起，神的恩典仍在照耀，而我的美国同胞们，最好的日子还在后面。 （掌声。）
 </p>
 <p>
  Thank you.  God Bless You.  And God Bless America.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)
  <br/>
  谢谢你们！上帝保佑你们，上帝保佑美国。（掌声。）
